                The 2018 SNO conference sessions represented a hybrid of topics on selected "systems" that contribute
                to sustainability and more traditional topics. Sessions included talks addressing applications, effects
                and implications, analytical methods, and lifecycle aspects of nanomaterials within each system. The
                aims were to identity where nanomaterials and nanotechnology can improve the sustainability of each
                system and to foster integration of knowledge between applications and implications within each system.
                We also aimed to encourage papers on the applications of nanomaterials to sustainability. Papers on
                lifecycle aspects of nanomaterials within each system or across systems were encouraged. New
                developments in analytical methods and instrumentation were also received. Topics from prior
                conferences were addressed under the current session topics.
              </p>

              <p>As always, in all our sessions, we ask how we are helping reach sustainability through nanotechnology:

                  Tribute to Barbara Karn<br>
                  Barbara Karn is co-founder and executive director of SNO. She retired from NSF where she directed a
                  program
                  funding research in environmental nanotechnology. Prior to that, she spent 10 years building the
                  environmental nanotechnology community—applications and implications- through grants at EPA. She
                  spent a
                  year working on green nanotechnology at the Wilson Center. Dr. Karn represented EPA on the NNI and
                  brought
                  nano environmental and human health issues to the European Community. She is most proud of being able
                  to
                  maintain this research community through the legacy of SNO.

                  <br>
                  This session centered on Nanotechnology for food production, pesticide delivery, nutrient delivery, disease suppression, food fortification, and environmental implications.

                  Water<br>
                  This session focused on applications of nanotechnology to address water or air contaminants,
                  including applications in water supply, wastewater treatment and industrial air pollution control.

                  Fate and Exposure
                  <br>
                  This session considered studies addressing nanomaterial release fate and transport,
                  transformations, and exposure modelling.

                  <br>
                  This session emphasized the evaluation of the effects (i.e. positive or negative) that advanced nanomaterials have on the environment and human health.

                  Life Cycle<br>
                  It is important to consider a life-cycle perspective when evaluating the applications of
                  nanotechnology,
                  from raw materials to synthesis, and from product use to end of life. Papers in this session addressed the entire life-cycle of particular applications, or the implications in specific life-cycle phases,
                  including recycling.

                  <br>
                  Papers in this session focus on the need to develop sensors, new instruments, approaches, and/or
                  further refinement of existing tools for characterizing nanomaterials and using nanomaterials as
                  sensors
                  to
                  detect chemicals of interest.

                  Green Synthesis<br>
                  This session focuses on the synthesis of nanomaterials with lowered energy and fewer polluting
                  by-products
                  and starting materials. Environmentally benign methods for forming in place, incorporating
                  lithography, vacuum coating and spray coating; mechanical synthesis (‘top-down’ method that reduces
                  the
                  size of particles by attrition, for example, ball milling or planetary grinding); gas phase
                  synthesis,
                  such as plasma vaporization, chemical vapor synthesis and laser ablation; and green wet chemistry.
                  Green
